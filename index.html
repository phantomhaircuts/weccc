      Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You no longer need those. Guards, leave us. I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master. You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father. Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things. His lightsaber. Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you. You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.
    </p>

      Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above! Red Three, Red Two, pull in! Got it! Three of them coming in, twenty degrees! Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate. Pressure's steady. Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for. We're in attack position now, sir. Hold here. We're not going to attack? I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.

      Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest. Yoda, I must know. Your father he is. Told you, did he? Yes. Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... Unfortunate that I know the truth? No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you. Well, I'm sorry. Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
