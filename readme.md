### Approach
- Started by creating the site according to the wireframe.

- The down caret in the "learn more about Darth" button seemed to imply an accordion fold, or scrolling. The footer contained the button to expand the bio and was a substantial part of the wireframe, so I decided to slide in the content from offscreen.

- Used a centered background image for mobile. Also decided to move down the sign up form to be in a more natural place for the user to tap with their thumbs. The site seemed cluttered on very small screens, removing the background image seemed to create a smoother overall experience.

### Challenges
- Searching for assets was a challenge.
- Finding free web fonts that matched the fonts in the wireframe.
- Creating the logo was a challenge, an SVG might be a more responsive and performant solution if the fonts aren't repeated throughout the site.
